Problem 1:
a) 
b) modified
c) README.md is modified; fun_problem.txt is new file
d) both are modified
e) README.md is modified (and staged)
	content of fun_problem.txt is empty, because...


Problem 3:
a) inner for loop: O(n)
	outer for loop: O(n)
	overall: O(n^2)
b) 
	for the inner for loop: size = 10*(2/3)^n = O((2/3)^n)
		runtime: sum(n=0 to log(base 2/3)size) * O(size) 
			= O(log(size)/log(2/3) * size)
			= O(n * (2/3)^n)
	for the outer for loop: O(n)
	Thus for overall: O(n * n * (2/3)^n) = O(n^2 * (2/3)^n)
c) inner for loop: size = 10 + n*sqrt(n) = O(n^1.5)
	outer for loop: O(n)
	overall: O(n * n^1.5) = O(n^2.5)

Problem 4:
1. a set of strings, because the order they are in doesn't matter; we only need to insert, remove, and check if the set contains a certain string
2. a map of string keys (student name) and string values (classes)
3. a list of strings (country names), because order matters
