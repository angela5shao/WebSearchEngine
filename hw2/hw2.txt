Problem 1:
a) unmodified
b) README.md is modified; fun_problem.txt is untracked
c) both are staged (fun_problem.txt is displayed as a new file while README.md is modified)
d) both are modified but not staged
e) README.md is staged
	content of fun_problem.txt is empty, because checkout reverts the file back to the (original) version that was stored in the repository (which was right after it was created)
f) README.md is not staged because it has been modified (text added)u


Problem 3:
a) inner for loop: O(n)
	outer for loop: O(n)
	overall: O(n^2)
b) 
	for the inner for loop: O(size) + O(size*(3/2)) + O(size*(3/2)^2) + O(size*(3/2)^3) + ...
		= O(1) + O(3/2) + O((3/2)^2) + O((3/2)^3) + ...
	for outer loop: O(n)
	Thus, overall: O(n) * (inner loop sum) = O(n * log_base3/2_n)
	
c) inner for loop: size = 10 + n*sqrt(n) = O(n^1.5)
	outer for loop: O(n)
	overall: O(n * n^1.5) = O(n^2.5)

Problem 4:
1. a set of strings, because the order they are in doesn't matter; we only need to insert, remove, and check if the set contains a certain string
2. a map of string keys (student name) and string values (classes)
3. a list of strings (country names), because order matters
